# RETROSPECTIVES
As a team you will have a retrospective.

During this meeting you will have a discussion with your team members.

You discuss what went well during the last sprint and what should be improved.

Possible questions to get you going:
* On a scale of 1â€“10, how do you feel this sprint went? Why?
* If you could go back in time and do this sprint again, what would you change and what wouldn't you change?
* What about this sprint was the biggest source of stress or difficulty for you personally?
* How did you cope with things that went wrong?
* What was the effect of earlier retrospectives?

In this document you will write down some conclusions.

## First Retrospective [4/06/2025]
*
1-10 it went like a 1, We had a lot of issues with the project, the mvers weren't done with their assets and whe had one week left.
And we saw that they changed the project to a linear story the problem is if we knew earlier we could have made a better project, which was much easier 10 times,
cause now we made the backend for nothing and its to complicated now and too late to change it back.

If we could go back in time, we would do a better job with the planning, cause even they the ones who made the story didn't know what they wanted, and everyone
said something different, and we listened ti the person who always present. cause the others were working from home. and we didn't know if they were really working or not, so that was a bit of a problem.

Communication was a big problem, we didn't know what the others were doing, and we didn't know if they were working or not, so that was a bit of a problem.
We thought they far because they were telling us that they were working on it, but we couldn't check either because they have all one asset which they're working on,
and they sent every day via teams progress, but later we realised those were drawings/sketch of things they wanted.

If things went wrong I tried to talk with them, but they were not responding, so I asked the teacher for help, and he was helpful.
and then they agreed like better planning and better communication, but it was too late.

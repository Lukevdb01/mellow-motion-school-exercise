# RETROSPECTIVES
As a team you will have a retrospective.

During this meeting you will have a discussion with your team members.

You discuss what went well during the last sprint and what should be improved.

Possible questions to get you going:
* On a scale of 1â€“10, how do you feel this sprint went? Why?
* If you could go back in time and do this sprint again, what would you change and what wouldn't you change?
* What about this sprint was the biggest source of stress or difficulty for you personally?
* How did you cope with things that went wrong?
* What was the effect of earlier retrospectives?

In this document you will write down some conclusions.

## First Retrospective [Date here]
*



This sprint felt like an 7, we have done less then last time but we made a lot of progress.
* I would change the way we communicate, we need to be more clear about what we want to do and check on others and make more notes.
* No one had really time and everyone was later then expected, but we managed to get everything done.
* Work hard hustling and try to get everything done.
* We have a better communication and we are more clear about what we want to do.
